I'm Robert, or Robo for short. I'm fairly new to the whole open source/github scene so please be patient with me.

I have a website the I update occasionally with things i've worked on. Currently it's showcasing a few of my non-github related projects, you can take a look [HERE!](https://robertzarmstrong.com/portfolio/)
